    h2 About Me
    p Armed with a Bachelor of Science New Media Communication degree from Middle Tennessee State University, I graduated in 2014 interested in pursuing Web Design and Development. I quickly fell in love with the front-end web development side of the field due to the unique challenges and problem-solving required to build successful websites. I came to love the gratification found in turning flat designs into interactive and full-functioning websites through code, and became excited about the seemingly infinite opportunities to learn and grow. Over the past 3 years I’ve been working hard to hone my skills as a Front-End Web Developer at the companies I’ve worked for and through freelance projects.

    p My wife and I recently relocated from Memphis, TN to San Antonio, TX for her job, so I’m currently seeking new opportunities to continue my career.

    p I am passionate about learning, always strive to do my best work, and pride myself on being self-motivated and focused on the job at hand. I place great value on Integrity and Professionalism, and seek to exemplify both in all that I do.

    h3 Areas of Interest
    p My interests include front-end web development, web design, graphic design, writing, drawing, art, photography, and photo-editing. I should also mention that I minored in writing- it's something I've always enjoyed. I especially enjoy learning, particularly about that which I'm passionate about. I don't know everything- I'll even admit that I know very little- but I'm always driven to find solutions to the questions I encounter. That's part of being creative- knowing how to find solutions. It's a learning process. I plan to never stop learning, particularly as I work in a field that is ever-evolving and changing. It's essential to learn everyday and to keep up with the latest trends.

    p Apart from being creative, I also enjoy running, spending time with my gorgeous wife, hanging out with friends and enjoying meaningful conversation with the people in my life.
