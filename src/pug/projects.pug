      | Freelance T-Shirt Design - 2015
    p This is a freelance T-Shirt design. The client provided me with a rough sketch and a picture of an existing T-Shirt they wanted me to model the design after. I created the design in Adobe Illustrator and did revisions for the client, providing a couple options for them to chose from.

      | Freelance Logo Design - 2014
    p This is a logo I designed for a client who wanted something along the lines of the "PHP elephant sitting in front of a book wearing glasses..." They also wanted it in a style reminiscent of the old Barnes and Noble Author posters ( #[a(href='https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS507US507&q=barnes+and+noble+author+posters+mark+summers&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi__5qgq7zgAhUHGKwKHe4yDz0QsAR6BAgAEAE&biw=1280&bih=690' target='_blank' rel='nofollow') See Here] ). I did a free-hand sketch of logo on pen and paper and then scanned the image into my computer and converted it to an Adobe Illustrator file for the completion of the editing.
