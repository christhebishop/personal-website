    p #[span.job-title Web Designer, Jr.] at G/O Digital, a digital marketing company in Nashville, TN.

As a Jr. Web Designer, I primarily built our Template adaptive and mobile websites using a white-labeled drag-and-drop website builder. In 2015 I began doing more Custom Website development, building websites from PSD comps using WordPress and FoundationPress, a free starter WordpPress theme built using the Foundation 5 Responsive Front-End Framework. I greatly enjoyed developing G/O Digital's Custom Websites as it challenged me as a developer and was a great learning experience.
