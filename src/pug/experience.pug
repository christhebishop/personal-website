    h3 Actively Seeking New Opportunities
    p My wife and I recently relocated from Memphis, TN to San Antonio, TX for her job, so I’m currently seeking new opportunities to continue my career.

    h3 October 2015-June 2017
    p I most recently worked as a FRONT-END DEVELOPER at Simple Focus, a user experience agency in Memphis, TN. At Simple Focus, I developed websites using best practices in HTML, CSS/SCSS, jQuery and JavaScript, and collaborated with other designers and developers to ensure optimal development solutions for design challenges. Part of my responsibilities included prioritizing code quality, semantics, site speed, responsive design/development, and being able to adapt to client needs to deliver quality products. I also helped support and maintain existing websites built in WordPress, Drupal, Shopify and Magento.

    h3 September 2014-October 2015
    p Worked as a WEB DESIGNER, JR. at G/O Digital, a digital marketing company in Nashville, TN. I began as an associate in June of 2014 and was hired on full time at the end of September 2014. As a Jr. Web Designer, I primarily built our Template adaptive and mobile websites using a white-labeled drag-and-drop website builder. In 2015 I began doing more Custom Website development, building websites from PSD comps using WordPress and FoundationPress, a free starter WordpPress theme built using the Foundation 5 Responsive Front-End Framework. I greatly enjoyed developing G/O Digital's Custom Websites as it challenged me as a developer and was a great learning experience.

    h3 June 2014-September 2014
    p Interned as a WEB DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATE at G/O Digital, a digital marketing company in Nashville, TN. As an associate, I provide fulfillment support to the Web Development Fulfillment team. My job includes producing regular scheduled tasks to assist the web fulfillment teams, the creation of reports and other general tasks, the development of Template Websites and the design Website Mockups.

    h3 October 2013-April 2014:
    p During my Senior year at MTSU, I interned for The A Group, a marketing and technology firm in Brentwood, TN. As an intern, I was mostly tasked with quality assurance for the technology/design team. I thoroughly tested websites, tested modules within the latest version of their Content Management Software, created and edited forms, tested apps, and touched on HTML and CSS coding.

    h3 January 2013-December 2013:
    p Worked as the ONLINE DIRECTOR for MTSU Sidelines, the student-run and editorially independent school newspaper. For this role, I was in charge of maintaining and updating the newspaper websites, managing social media accounts, weekly posting articles to the website, and some archiving from the previous website.

    h3 October 2012-December 2013
    p During this period I worked as the SOCIAL MEDIA INTERN/VOLUNTEER for Bonhoeffer's, a weekly music venue that serves college students through live music and free coffee.
