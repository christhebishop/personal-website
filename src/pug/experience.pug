      | Sept<span>ember</span> 2014 - Oct<span>ober</span> 2015
    p Worked as a WEB DESIGNER, JR. at G/O Digital, a digital marketing company in Nashville, TN. I began as an associate in June of 2014 and was hired on full time at the end of September 2014. As a Jr. Web Designer, I primarily built our Template adaptive and mobile websites using a white-labeled drag-and-drop website builder. In 2015 I began doing more Custom Website development, building websites from PSD comps using WordPress and FoundationPress, a free starter WordpPress theme built using the Foundation 5 Responsive Front-End Framework. I greatly enjoyed developing G/O Digital's Custom Websites as it challenged me as a developer and was a great learning experience.
