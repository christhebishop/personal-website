      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Armed with a Bachelor of Science New Media Communication degree from Middle Tennessee State University, I graduated in 2014 interested in pursuing Web Design and Development. I quickly fell in love with the front-end web development side of the field due to the unique challenges and problem-solving required to build successful websites. I came to love the gratification found in turning flat designs into interactive and full-functioning websites through code, and became excited about the seemingly infinite opportunities to learn and grow. Over the past 3 years I’ve been working hard to hone my skills as a Front-End Web Developer at the companies I’ve worked for and through freelance projects.</p>
      <p>My wife and I recently relocated from Memphis, TN to San Antonio, TX for her job, so I’m currently seeking new opportunities to continue my career.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about learning, always strive to do my best work, and pride myself on being self-motivated and focused on the job at hand. I place great value on Integrity and Professionalism, and seek to exemplify both in all that I do.</p>
      <h3>My skills include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS/SCSS</li>
        <li>Command Line/Terminal</li>
        <li>Basic JavaScript/jQuery</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Custom WordPress Development</li>
        <li>Proficiency in Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator and Sketch</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>In addition to building websites, I enjoy hanging out at local coffee shops, running, spending time with my gorgeous wife, chilling with our semi-friendly cat, hanging out with friends and enjoying meaningful conversation with the people in my life. </p>
