      <p>I most recently worked as a FRONT-END DEVELOPER at Simple Focus, a user experience agency in Memphis, TN. At Simple Focus, I developed websites using best practices in HTML, CSS/SCSS, jQuery and JavaScript, and collaborated with other designers and developers to ensure optimal development solutions for design challenges. Part of my responsibilities included prioritizing code quality, semantics, site speed, responsive design/development, and being able to adapt to client needs to deliver quality products. I also helped support and maintain existing websites built in WordPress, Drupal, Shopify and Magento.</p>

      <p>Worked as a WEB DESIGNER, JR. at G/O Digital, a digital marketing company in Nashville, TN. I began as an associate in June of 2014 and was hired on full time at the end of September 2014. As a Jr. Web Designer, I primarily built our Template adaptive and mobile websites using a white-labeled drag-and-drop website builder. In 2015 I began doing more Custom Website development, building websites from PSD comps using WordPress and FoundationPress, a free starter WordpPress theme built using the Foundation 5 Responsive Front-End Framework. I greatly enjoyed developing G/O Digital's Custom Websites as it challenged me as a developer and was a great learning experience.</p>
